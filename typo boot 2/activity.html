    Computer programming or coding is the composition of sequences of instructions, called <mark>programs</mark>, that computers can follow to perform tasks. It involves designing and implementing algorithms, step-by-step specifications of
    procedures, by writing code in one or more <mark>programming languages</mark>. E.g; <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML
    </abbr> has many elements and tags such as <code>table</code>, <code>p</code>, <code>button</code>, etc. <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> is used to style our webpage and improve its presentation and looks. We use <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> for pasting anything. We can use <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>p</kbd> to print only one copy.

        Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses algorithms, procedures, and processes to examine large amounts of
        data in order to uncover hidden patterns, generate insights, and direct decision-making. To create prediction models, data scientists use advanced machine learning algorithms to sort through, organize, and learn from structured and unstructured data.<br><br><b>
